## About Me

I graduated from [Williams College](https://williams.edu/) in June, 2024 with a B.A. with Honors in Computer Science and Economics. 

My research mainly lies in the intersection of Machine Learning and Causal Inference. I wrote my undergraduate thesis with Prof. [Rohit Bhattacharya](https://rohit-bhattacharya.com/) on developing novel causal inference methods in social networks where data is non-i.i.d. (non-independent and identically distributed). My thesis can be accessed [here](https://librarysearch.williams.edu/discovery/delivery/01WIL_INST:01WIL_SPECIAL/12406122570002786).

In summer 2023, I participated in the [SMALL NSF REU](https://math.williams.edu/small/) program and collaborated with [CSAFE](https://forensicstats.org/) to improve the robustness and explainability of machine learning models for shoeprint matching in forensic applications. I was fortunate to receive direct guidance from Profs. [Xizhen Cai](https://sites.google.com/view/xizhen-cai/), [Anna Plantinga](https://sites.google.com/view/annaplantinga/home), and [Elizabeth Upton](https://www.eupton.com/) during this experience.

## Research Interests

I'm interted in AI reliability, including robustness, safety, and generalizability. I'd like to investigate why models fail in certain scenarios and create methods to help models perform reliably across diverse real-world contexts.
