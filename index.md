## About Me

I'm a first year PhD student at MIT department of EECS, adviced by Prof. [Caroline Uhler](https://www.carolineuhler.com/). I graduated from [Williams College](https://williams.edu/) in June, 2024 with a B.A. with Honors in Computer Science and Economics.

I wrote my undergraduate thesis with Prof. [Rohit Bhattacharya](https://rohit-bhattacharya.com/) on developing novel causal inference methods in social networks where data is non-i.i.d. (non-independent and identically distributed). My thesis can be accessed [here](https://librarysearch.williams.edu/discovery/delivery/01WIL_INST:01WIL_SPECIAL/12406122570002786).

In summer 2023, I participated in the [SMALL NSF REU](https://math.williams.edu/small/) program and collaborated with [CSAFE](https://forensicstats.org/) to improve the robustness and explainability of machine learning models for shoeprint matching in forensic applications.

I'm generally interested in AI/ML and causal inference. I particularly enjoy creating methodological advancements that are grounded in theory.
