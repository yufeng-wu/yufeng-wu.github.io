## About Me

I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at MIT, advised by Prof. [Caroline Uhler](https://www.carolineuhler.com/). I graduated from [Williams College](https://williams.edu/) in 2024 with a B.A. in Computer Science and Economics.

I wrote my undergraduate [thesis](https://librarysearch.williams.edu/discovery/delivery/01WIL_INST:01WIL_SPECIAL/12406122570002786) with Prof. [Rohit Bhattacharya](https://rohit-bhattacharya.com/) on developing novel causal inference methods in network data where observations are not independent and identically distributed.

In summer 2023, I participated in the [SMALL REU](https://math.williams.edu/small/) program and collaborated with [CSAFE](https://forensicstats.org/) to improve the robustness of ML models for shoeprint matching in forensic applications.

I'm generally interested in AI/ML and causal inference. I particularly enjoy creating methodological advancements that are grounded in theory. If you're interested in discussing research or potential collaborations, feel free to reach out via email!
